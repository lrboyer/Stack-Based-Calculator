# Stack-Based-Calculator
# To use type ./calculator

# USAGE: can take infix and postfix operations just need a space between each value or operator

# INFO FOR HOW IT WORKS: 
  # FOR INFIX: uses a stack to first convert the infix expression to make a postfix expression then calls then calculates the postfix expression using a stack
  # FOR POSTFIX: just uses a stack to calculate the expression

# MORE INFO
  # Used two class projects: an infix to postfix expression converter and a postfix calculator to help make this. I just combined them together to make a working infix calculator.
